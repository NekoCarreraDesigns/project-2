# project-2

This is the TravelTo app it lets a user search for fun activities to do in our lovely state of Colorado. The user can add locations, and activities, update the places they have been, and delete items of their choosing. using the Adventure Projects API, which is an outdoor api website that has locations all over the world. Our app currently uses Colorado as its base, future developments will include geolocation to show items in the users specific area, and eventually the world when Americans are no longer banned in other countries.

# Usage
